<h2> What Is The treaty Of Waitangi?</h2>
        <p>The Treaty of Waitangi, also known as Te Tiriti o Waitangi in Māori, is a foundational agreement signed in 1840 between the British Crown and Māori chiefs. It outlines rights, land ownership, and shared governance, shaping New Zealand’s history and cultural identity.</p>
        
<h2>Origins and Signing</h2>
<p>
On 6 February 1840, the Treaty was signed in the Bay of Islands between the British Crown and approximately 540 Māori rangatira (chiefs).</p>
<h2>Who Was Involved</h2>     
<p>
Lieutenant-Governor William Hobson played a pivotal role in securing British sovereignty over New Zealand, with support from James Busby, the British Resident in the country.
The Treaty was prepared in haste, translated overnight by missionary Henry Williams and his son Edward.</p>
<h2>Content and Intent</h2>
<h2>What is Written in the Treaty of Waitangi?</h2>
<p>
The Treaty consists of three articles.
In the English version, Māori ceded sovereignty to Britain, granting the Crown exclusive land-buying rights while ensuring Māori retained full ownership of their lands, forests, fisheries, and possessions.
            Māori were also granted the rights and privileges of British subjects.</p>
<h2>Problems With the Treaty of Waitangi</h2>
<p>
Notably, the Māori version translated ‘sovereignty’ as ‘kawanatanga’ (governance), emphasizing shared authority.
Debates and Signatories:
Around 500 Māori debated the document for a day and night before signing it.
By September, another 500 chiefs had signed copies sent throughout the country.
Some chiefs remained uncertain, while others had no opportunity to sign.
The Colonial Office in England later declared that the Treaty applied to Māori tribes whose chiefs had not signed.
        </p>
<h2>Impact and Legacy</h2>   
<p>
British sovereignty over New Zealand was proclaimed on 21 May 1840.
The Treaty laid the groundwork for a political compact between the British and Māori, establishing a nation state and government.
Despite challenges and differing interpretations, the Treaty remains a touchstone for discussions on rights, land, and partnership.</p>
